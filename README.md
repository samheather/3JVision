3JVision
========
IMPORTANT: You must have installed OpenCV natively for this to work, and if using Ubuntu with OpenCV installed via apt-get, you may run into library problems.  I gave up on these as I only needed it to run on Mac for a quick demo, but if you do figure out where the correct .so is, please let me know or submit a pull request so it's fixed for all.

<p>To use:</p>
-Build and run.  
-Ensure you have a camera connected to your computer.  
-Then, once the cube appears, move your head and watch as the cube responds.
